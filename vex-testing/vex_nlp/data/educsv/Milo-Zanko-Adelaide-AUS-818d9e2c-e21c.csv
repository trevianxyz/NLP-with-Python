"So my name is Mill Zankov.",,,,
"I'm teaching in Adelaide, Australia.",,,,
"I started with Vex in 2018 when Vex, Australia opened up a branch and warehouse and headquarters in Adelaide.",,,,
"And so my involvement is as a teacher across predominantly middle to high school in terms of the classroom setting.",,,,
"But then I have role in terms of professional development across R to twelve and then I do some work with university sectors in terms of training preservice teachers.",,,,
"And so my involvement with X has been across all the programs.",,,,
"Just recently I've been doing professional development with One, Two, Three and Go for our junior primary and primary teachers and then within the upper years teaching both in the classroom and then training some new staff as well.",,,,
"In the competitive side with the program it's been diverse because obviously we as the first school in the state to really start Vex and then run the regional competitions, there's been a lot of professional development on the competitive side for schools around the state and that's across sectors.",,,,
"So government, non government schools.",,,,
"So my goals in Stem education are to continue growing the diversity of students and schools that are within the Vex program.",,,,
"Because for me, we had in the Adelaide region as an example, 16 schools involved bid over 400 students, which is a fantastic number in the state.",,,,
"But that equally means that there are thousands of students that have not had an opportunity and hundreds of teachers and equally schools as well.",,,,
"So for me it's about scaling the program and that's a big component.",,,,
"I guess I'm more thinking on a macro level now because within my school I've managed to get that golden, I guess, drive within teachers internally now in both computer science and the program where I could leave the school and it survives.",,,,
"And so now I start to think about how can I ensure that there's a lot more students in the state that get access to the program and equally help those teachers and other programs nationally that can make sure that Vex keeps growing.",,,,
"So I guess personally my background is in computer science teaching and that's what I've been doing for 15 plus years.",,,,
"That area that Vex is covering in terms of the professional development side is very good in terms of teaching other teachers how to program and put that together.",,,,
"So I feel like that's covered.",,,,
"But an area for me that is continually, I guess, something that I look to grow in is the mechanical engineering side.",,,,
"And so I feel like in some ways the computer science environment professionally the development has hit, it's never going to hit maturity, but it's very good and the components of that are excellent.",,,,
"And so it's this, I guess, be it with virtual support in terms of ensuring that there's CAD development and training for teachers like myself, that wasn't our background, but then equally as well skill sets around ensuring that we get the mechanical engineering components right.",,,,
"So that's at a really small level, sorry, at more of a classroom level in terms of personally improvement, and then in a larger area, it's always that space of ensuring that competition support exists and grows as the program in our state.",,,,
"As an example, moving out of just having 16 schools will probably double that this year.",,,,
"All that remains and continues.",,,,
"it.",,,,
"So an area that I think a lot of teachers when they get to a program as large as mine in terms of the extracurricular program.",,,,
"So even though we've only got 150 students, we're probably the largest school in the state in terms of an extracurricular robotics program.",,,,
"It sounds silly, but it's definitely something that teachers ask me a lot in Adelaide, Australia, around, is management of those resources in terms of classroom setup or workspace or workshop setup.",,,,
"That is a continual area that is always growing.",,,,
"And so you can have schools that potentially are often introducing these parts, pieces, materials for the very first time.",,,,
"They might have traditional woodwork, metalwork, et cetera, but the actual setup of that environment is something that is often not discussed, it's found and stumbled upon, and you work it out as suddenly you've gone from five boxes off robots equipment to 25, 30.",,,,
"And so I feel like that's a component of parts materials warehouse that is assumed that you'll just be able to do and understand.",,,,
"But it's actually one of my biggest challenges now as I've gathered an enormous amount of resources of equipment over the years since 2018 that I've now dealing with.",,,,
"And that's an important component because we have many more students now wanting to access those resources from the gone are the days of 30 students in the program.",,,,
"So that's an area to look at.",,,,
"You.",,,,
"I think the accessibility to high end teams or coaches or programs in the states that have been running for US international teams is very important and might be an area to really encourage and set up virtually and to have those conversations.",,,,
"So what my blue sky thinking around that space is I met a couple of teachers at Welds, and they took photos of how their massive setups or their robotic setups occur.",,,,
"That I guess in a PD plus sense would be interesting.",,,,
"And I'm just brainstorming now, let's say if you had time zone or virtual time zone setups for something like, how do you deal with 100 kilos worth of Vex equipment in your classroom?",,,,
"Then if there was an opportunity to virtually come in via Google meets or whatever it was, to have a live conversation for ten minutes where that person on the other end is in their room in their environment, they're showing me their set up.",,,,
"They're showing me from the storage of how they're doing things like sea channels, et cetera.",,,,
"And where are they being placed and in their room.",,,,
"And giving me a tour.",,,,
"And I'm able to ask them questions about how that functions for me at a level where the program in my school is obviously bursting at the seams in terms of the parts and pieces and materials.",,,,
"Like I said in the previous question, that can sometimes be, I guess, not looked at directly because it's just an assumed practice.",,,,
"But I think you got to remember from Australian schools getting into the program, they've never had this amount of equipment and set up, and so they don't have access to, I guess, in the States, many thousands of tens of thousands of schools involved in the program who they naturally can just almost drive to a school and go, show me how you've set it up.",,,,
"We don't have that.",,,,
"And it's very early days still in Australia in that space.",,,,
"So we need more of that resourcing and support that decide.",,,,
"And I think that's important because if you can do that, you encourage people knowing how to handle Vex in terms of the parts and pieces, because if we don't, well, then we'll always kind of limit it based on how much resourcing a school is willing to sort of give someone in terms of cupboard space.",,,,
"Whereas if you can show them this is accessible for everyone, this is how we do it, then you have continual growth.",,,,
"So thank you very much, Jason and the team.",,,,
"Yeah.",,,,
"Is this a summary?",,,,
"Is this him finishing up?",,,,
"There might be one more question.",,,,
"It might be maybe one more so.",,,,
"Success story for me is just seeing the fact that we've had students this year, my full so come full cycle.",,,,
"So they started when Vex came to Australia in 2018 in IQ, and just with only a year or so to go before they finished school, they managed to qualify for Welds.",,,,
"And that was having those ups and downs throughout in terms of them building and growing as a team and all those other components was amazing to see.",,,,
"I mean, for me, I've always said to them that it's just the growth in them that's the rewarding experience, and they know that as well.",,,,
"But to have that, I guess, added element of achieving an opportunity to see other teams from around the world who are the best of the best for the season was just the icing on the cake.",,,,
"And I think that's been amazing.",,,,
"And from the other side of it is to have teams that otherwise would never participate in competitions like this through very minimal funding, suddenly say we do want to get involved.",,,,
"And so seeing that the school is able to provide the regional competition for teams to come and participate in that space and those students see that as their Welds tournament in a way, because they're just having an experience with other students that they never would of originally, I think that's just amazing.",,,,
"And so it can be a student seeing a small regional competition as their Worlds tournament all the way through to those students, knowing what Worlds was and is and then actually being here and seeing that has been amazing.",,,,
"So, thank you.",,,,
"You it.",,,,
"So I guess a lesson that perhaps didn't work out with Vex was moving too quickly to building an IQ robot and then running an autonomous challenge in terms of students programming or mimicking basically, what was happening in the industry with autonomous cars.",,,,
"I think what was interesting with that whole unit, which we're retweaking and changing, is the excitement around autonomous vehicles for students I perceived was going to be there, but it wasn't.",,,,
"And so they're more interested in some of the mechanical componentry in terms of how and functions a robot versus giving them an opportunity to explore the ethical and implications of autonomous vehicles on the roads, et cetera.",,,,
"What I found in that particular grade eight class wasn't there.",,,,
"So when we changed tact and moved into some of the nuts and bolts off mechanics, off a robot, et cetera, and moved away from that, build a basic robot mover, et cetera, and think about the autonomy of what's happening yeah, that definitely is an area that when that lesson was happening, I thought, okay, there's some tweaks here to be made.",,,,
"So, yeah, that was one component.",,,,

"Okay.",,,,
"I'm Chris Collins.",,,,
"I've been teaching robotics, or specifically Vex IQ for about six years, exclusively Vex IQ.",,,,
"Next year, I'm going to get into the Vex Go, and most of my teaching career, I've been a fourth grade teacher, but this year was my first year as a GT specialist.",,,,
"And so I'm excited about getting into the Vex Go, and even more excited getting one, two, three and trying to find ways that I can not just have it on me, but have it on the teachers to participate and to get this into their classrooms.",,,,
"All right, next question.",,,,
"Thank you for information about yourself.",,,,
"Really appreciate that.",,,,
"What are your goals with Stem or computer science education?",,,,
"Again, if you're just getting started with Vex or you've been doing Vex for a while, do you want to continue your program?",,,,
"Do you want to expand what you're doing with your program?",,,,
"Maybe you're in the classroom, and you want to go to competitions, maybe doing competitions.",,,,
"You want to go back in the classroom, or maybe you're just thinking about implementing Stem, and you want to implement Stem with that.",,,,
"Tell us what your goals are with Stem education.",,,,
"My goals are to become more to do more of the go in the one, two, three, and to also push it into the classrooms.",,,,
"I need more training on it, for sure.",,,,
"And then once I've gotten the training and I feel very comfortable with it, I will try to push into teachers classes and help them implement it in the classroom using multiple parts of the curriculum, multiple subjects.",,,,
"So that's my goal, to become a bigger Stem campus than we are right now.",,,,
"Okay, great.",,,,
"Now that we know what your goals are with Stem education, tell us what you feel some of the impediments might be.",,,,
"What is in the way of you achieving your goals in Stem education?",,,,
"Is it teacher training?",,,,
"Do you need more professional development?",,,,
"You need to learn more about something like Python coding or you want to better at engineering?",,,,
"What is it that you feel if you learned or you did or you received professional development on, or if we created a resource for you could really take what you are doing to the next level?",,,,
"Well, definitely obstacle is resources, getting money to finance, getting more equipment.",,,,
"There's only so much the district will supply me with, and it's a very slow process, and I'd like for it to be faster.",,,,
"I definitely would like more professional development.",,,,
"And being here, I think being part of PD Plus finally, I think will help out a lot.",,,,
"I'm going to use a lot of the resources for PD Plus online and try to use that to get better at coding, get better at engineering.",,,,
"Until now, I've had a hard time trying to find out how to troubleshoot.",,,,
"I've kind of troubleshooted troubleshooting.",,,,
"For the most part, it's trial and error.",,,,
"Why is this not working.",,,,
"Well, let's try this.",,,,
"And I'll sit there, and it takes up a lot of time when you don't know what you're doing, why the brain is acting this way.",,,,
"Why is this happening?",,,,
"Why isn't this working?",,,,
"Stuff like that.",,,,
"And the programming, we've been very reluctant to do the autonomous part, the coding, because I just don't have that experience.",,,,
"Okay.",,,,
"This question is kind of related to the question I just asked.",,,,
"If you could change one thing about either Vex or your Stem implementation, what would make your life easier as an educator, what could we provide for you that could really make what you're doing with Stem a lot easier than what you are currently doing right now?",,,,
"Let us know that, please.",,,,
"We would love to be able to provide that for you.",,,,
"Lesson plans.",,,,
"And I know you all do have something like that online.",,,,
"I haven't dabbled in it yet, but definitely lesson plans that have multiple disciplines, especially when you're pairing math and science together or reading and writing together, because that's usually how our teachers are blocked.",,,,
"A math teacher is not going to want to sit there and use it for one particular thing I see that the teachers want.",,,,
"How can we double dip?",,,,
"How can we kill two birds with 1 st?",,,,
"So, more lessons, making the brains a little bit easier for the kids to deal with.",,,,
"I have all the old first generation of brains.",,,,
"We have 1 second generation.",,,,
"And I do see the difference in the interface on the brain.",,,,
"That is a big help.",,,,
"Further explanation.",,,,
"Before I came to this convention, I did see that there are some videos explaining a few things here and there, some of the sensors and whatnot.",,,,
"That's good.",,,,
"Just more information, more ways for me to get teachers in the classroom excited.",,,,
"I'm not a classroom teacher.",,,,
"I'm a teacher that I pull out and my kids and I teach robotics as an after school thing.",,,,
"That's one thing I need to know a little bit more about.",,,,
"How am I going to do one, two, three, and go.",,,,
"Is it going to be after school thing?",,,,
"I personally think it should be just woven into the curriculum, but we're working on that.",,,,
"All right, thank you for information.",,,,
"That's wonderful.",,,,
"Is there anything else that you want to share with us?",,,,
"Anything that you want to share with us that you think, again, would be valuable feedback that we can take with us back to our offices.",,,,
"And again, use your feedback to make any of our platforms or Vex Code VR or Vex Professional plus that much better for you.",,,,
"So take this question again and just wax poetic about anything that you would like.",,,,
"Be honest with us.",,,,
"Be really honest.",,,,
"Don't be afraid to tell us that something that we have is terrible.",,,,
"Be honest with us and let us know what it is that we can do to improve or if there is something that you really love, you can let us know that.",,,,
"Also.",,,,
"I like for there to be a program to where you can I mean, I have kits, but they are older kits, and I'm missing little pieces here and there.",,,,
"I don't want to have to buy a whole giant set just to get new brains.",,,,
"Or, you know, I would like an option to where you can buy new pieces that you all may have that I won't have to buy a giant kit for.",,,,
"I feel like Vex go, I've kind of dabbled a little bit with it.",,,,
"I haven't used it with kids yet.",,,,
"Like I said, I just got it and I feel like there should be more parts to it.",,,,
"More pieces, like maybe supplemental pieces that I could add.",,,,
"And maybe this is I don't know.",,,,
"Like I said, I haven't tried it quite yet with kids.",,,,
"I'm still kind of playing around with it just to get a good feel of it.",,,,
"I don't understand why I need so much of a foam packaging.",,,,
"I mean, it comes in pretty handy cases as it is.",,,,
"I feel like that money for the padded bags probably could have gone for maybe a cheaper kit.",,,,
"So I don't think the carrying cases are necessary.",,,,
"One of my favorite parts about this job is I get to travel the world and talk to educators all the time.",,,,
"And I love hearing about the success stories with Vex Robotics.",,,,
"Whether it's a parent talking about how their student now is so much more engaged in school as a result of Vex, or a student talking about how much they love engineering now or how much they love computer science.",,,,
"If you have any of those success stories, whether it's about competitions, classrooms, or books, we would love to hear that.",,,,
"So please share that with us.",,,,
"Well, like I said, I've been teaching it for six years now, and I have had kids in my first group who are still doing robotics, and they have come back and told me that they appreciate me.",,,,
"It was me that got them started on the path that they are on.",,,,
"So that's definitely rewarding.",,,,
"It's great to hear that.",,,,
"I always love getting feedback from old students.",,,,
"So to hear that, it's great, it's awesome.",,,,
"And hopefully I can expand our program and get more of those stories.",,,,
"Okay, this is one of my favorite questions to ask educators.",,,,
"And again, please be honest.",,,,
"Don't be shy.",,,,
"Tell me about that one lesson with facts that went terrible.",,,,
"Tell me about that one lesson.",,,,
"You couldn't wait to walk into school and teach this particular lesson and it just went bad.",,,,
"It fell flat.",,,,
"It didn't work out.",,,,
"For whatever reason.",,,,
"We would love to know why so we can fix that particular lesson.",,,,
"Now, as a corollary to that, you can either conclude this or as an or let us know about that one student or that group of students that you were not able to reach with.",,,,
"Becks you thought that after the exposure to your robotics club or to your classroom effect, that these students would want to go on and pursue engineering careers or computer science or just really kind of be engaged with it, but for whatever reason, it didn't work out.",,,,
"We would love to hear that.",,,,
"I don't really teach it as a lesson for Veg's IQ.",,,,
"It's more after school.",,,,
"We talk a little bit about the engineering notebook and the process you go through to create a robot.",,,,
"But I don't really have lessons.",,,,
"I do find a lot of the kids, and I'm hoping that go in one, two, three will help this.",,,,
"But when the kids come to me in fourth and fifth grade, they very clueless.",,,,
"They'll come up with ideas that have nothing to do with the competition or that won't help, because they're still learning how to put the parts together and still kind of getting familiar with all of it.",,,,
"But I think that's why I was pushing for Vex Go so much.",,,,
"I was hoping that using Vex Go would help me get more qualified kids to go to IQ.",,,,
"Then they can go on from there into middle school.",,,,
"So I don't really have any bad lessons, so I guess that's probably how I can't help with that one.",,,,
"So thank you very much for participating with our survey.",,,,
"We, of course, are not going to share of your information with anyone.",,,,
"We will keep everything confidential.",,,,
"We just want to use this for our.",,,,

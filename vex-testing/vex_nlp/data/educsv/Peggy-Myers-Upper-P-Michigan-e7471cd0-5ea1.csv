"I'm Peggy Myers.",,,,
"I am a middle school teacher, 6th through 8th grade at Hancock Middle School up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.",,,,
"We use Vex from elementary all the way through high school.",,,,
"The middle schoolers and elementary schoolers are using Vex IQ.",,,,
"The high school is using vex EXP.",,,,
"We and then was there another question on that one or not?",,,,
"All right, next question.",,,,
"Thank you for information about yourself.",,,,
"Really appreciate that.",,,,
"What are your goals with Stem or computer scientific again?",,,,
"If you're just getting started with Vex or you've been doing Vex for a while, you want to continue your program.",,,,
"Do you want to expand what you're doing with your program?",,,,
"Maybe you're in the classroom.",,,,
"You want to go to competitions, maybe competitions.",,,,
"You want to go back in the classroom.",,,,
"Or maybe you're just thinking about implementing Stem and you want to implement it.",,,,
"You want to implement Stem with Vex.",,,,
"Tell us what your goals are with Stem education.",,,,
"We have a robotics program starting in elementary school, and it goes all the way through high school.",,,,
"We've done our first competition this year, but it was at the end of the season.",,,,
"We had problems getting our Vex playing fields and some of our materials in on time for the kids to really be competitive for much of the season.",,,,
"This year was definitely a learning season for us.",,,,
"Our goals with Becks are we'd like to host a competition this upcoming October, so we're looking for information and mentorship on that and then follow on goals.",,,,
"We would like our students to have marketable skills when they leave high school, some going on to college and some just getting employed straight out of high school.",,,,
"We've been talking to community leaders and manufacturers, other companies within our community, to see what skills they would like their workforce to have coming out of school.",,,,
"With robotics being such a high portion of manufacturing, we feel that's an important part of our important part of the curricula is that manufacturing tool and changing the perception of what manufacturing looks like from what it used to be to something that's more clean, more friendly to females in the workplace.",,,,
"Lots of different things there.",,,,
"The other thing that we're using Becks for is computer science and the coding aspect of it.",,,,
"So kids that want to go that direction, they've got a good platform with that.",,,,
"We found that the block coding, and it's a great tool.",,,,
"We've been starting our kids out on scratch to get them used to the coating before we started with Vex, and that loading real naturally.",,,,
"Okay, great.",,,,
"Now that we know what your goals are with Stem education, tell us what you feel some of the impediments might be.",,,,
"What is in the way of you achieving your goals in Stem education?",,,,
"Is it teacher training?",,,,
"If you need more professional development, you need to learn more about something like Python coding or you want to better at engineering?",,,,
"What is it that you feel if you learned or you did or you receive professional development on, or if we create a resource for you could really take what you are doing to the next level.",,,,
"We are working on professional development right now for our teachers so that we're up to speed on everything.",,,,
"I think we've got a pretty enthusiastic crew, so we're out looking for opportunities.",,,,
"We sent a teacher to this conference last year, so her experience, her team at the competition said much better than mine.",,,,
"This is my first time using Becks, and this is my first conference, and it's nice to see how everything goes.",,,,
"Just the format of everything and how the competition is run, how the teams are built.",,,,
"All the small details that you just absorb by seeing our challenges really are that we're located so far in the north of the Upper Peninsula that competitions are difficult for us to get to, logistically, being up in Hancock, Michigan.",,,,
"So we would like to host a small competition up near us and maybe with some schools in Wisconsin.",,,,
"Many of those are closer.",,,,
"Okay.",,,,
"This question is kind of related to the question I just asked.",,,,
"If you could change one thing about either Vex or your Stem implementation, what would make your life easier as an educator, what could we provide for you that could really make what you're doing with Stem a lot easier than what you are currently doing right now?",,,,
"Let us know that, please, and we would love to be able to provide that for you.",,,,
"I think the website is difficult to navigate at times.",,,,
"There's a lot of information there, so I think all the information is there.",,,,
"I think it's hard to find sometimes.",,,,
"There's a lot of marketing on the surface, and we have to dig through the marketing and the pitches to get through to what we're actually looking for.",,,,
"There have been some times when the kids are trying to troubleshoot when sensors aren't recognizing the right colors and things like that, and it's been hard for them to find short little troubleshooting for those types of things when they're trying to figure out why their controller is not working right or the sensors don't seem to be operating quite right.",,,,
"There's not really a flow chart or a checklist to see.",,,,
"Hey, if this is going wrong, check first.",,,,
"If the sensor is not working right, what should they check first?",,,,
"What should they check second?",,,,
"Like a computational thinking kind of flowchart troubleshooting.",,,,
"Troubleshooting flowchart would be really helpful for them.",,,,
"All right, thank you for information.",,,,
"That's wonderful.",,,,
"Is there anything else that you want to share with us?",,,,
"Anything that you want to share with us that you think, again, would be valuable feedback that we can take with us back to our offices and again, use your feedback to make any of our platforms or Vex code VR or Vex professionals on the part, that much better for you.",,,,
"So take this question again to just wax poetic about anything that you would like.",,,,
"Be honest with us.",,,,
"Be really honest.",,,,
"Don't be afraid to tell us that something that we have is terrible.",,,,
"Be honest with us and let us know what it is that we can do to improve.",,,,
"Or if there is something that you really love, you can let us know that also.",,,,
"I think that when I allow my kids to do free build, how I've been using some of your labs and competitions is we start with that.",,,,
"We get for that.",,,,
"We use that as the basic bare bones.",,,,
"And then I let them create their own competition.",,,,
"They collaborate together at the board.",,,,
"They make up their own rules.",,,,
"They're allowed to use the playing field and manipulate the playing field how they would like to build their own classroom competition.",,,,
"So I think with the classroom kits, it would be cool if they had spare parts that they could use to go beyond the regular classroom kits.",,,,
"I think that would be helpful too.",,,,
"So we ended up with five.",,,,
"We bought five kits for our classrooms, for the regular labs, and then one competition kit.",,,,
"I feel like that limited their creativity.",,,,
"Having just one competition kit for class and the five regular standard kits spare parts would be great.",,,,
"And I'm just diving in now to some of the labs, having the kids do the different labs on the different gear ratios and things like that.",,,,
"So we're still learning a lot, but I think that's it.",,,,
"Thanks.",,,,
"Definitely one of my favorite parts about this job is it seemed like it was the last question all the time.",,,,
"And I love hearing about the success stories.",,,,
"He got that everybody else like anything else question.",,,,
"I'd assume it was last or a.",,,,
"Student talking about how much they love engineering now, how much they love computer science.",,,,
"If you have any of those success stories, whether it's about competition classrooms or books, we would love to hear that.",,,,
"So please share that with us.",,,,
"Well, so we've only went to one competition so far.",,,,
"The kids didn't.",,,,
"I mean, they competed, they had great attitude, but seeing that it was the end of the season, mostly their teams had their robots dialed in pretty well, and this was their first iteration.",,,,
"Like I said, we didn't get our playing field until after we had left for the competition.",,,,
"So they didn't have any time to practice on the playing field at all before went.",,,,
"I think that the best part that they took from it was that how the other team helped them out and collaborated with them and said, hey, I think you need this.",,,,
"And they helped them help them make quick adjustments to the robot in between matches.",,,,
"So the team collaborations from the other schools was probably the best part.",,,,
"Okay, this is one of my favorite questions to ask educators.",,,,
"And again, please be honest.",,,,
"Don't be shy.",,,,
"Tell me about that one lesson with facts that went terrible.",,,,
"Tell me about that one lesson.",,,,
"You couldn't wait to walk into school and teach this particular lesson, and it just went bad.",,,,
"It fell flat.",,,,
"It didn't work out for whatever reason.",,,,
"We would love to know why so we could fix that particular lesson.",,,,
"Now, as a corollary to that, you can either include this or as an or let us know about that one student or that group of students that you were not able to reach with Vex.",,,,
"You thought that after the exposure to your robotics club or to your classroom with Vexa, these students would want to go on and pursue engineering careers or computer science or just really kind of be engaged with it, but for whatever reason, it didn't work out.",,,,
"We would love to hear that.",,,,
"Well, I don't have a typical answer for this one.",,,,
"The way that I structure the classroom, we don't follow a precise lab one, lab two, lab three, lab four.",,,,
"I let the kids go in.",,,,
"I let them do some free build time, and then I show them what the competition is going to be, and I direct them to the instructional website, and they watch the videos and they build on their own.",,,,
"Usually, if they're coming up with problems, I redirect them back and point them to a group that's successful.",,,,
"So I guess I don't have a lesson that failed because I'm not teaching it in a traditional, teacher centered lesson environment.",,,,
"It's all about the kids.",,,,
"And if the kids want to if the classroom goes off of the lesson plan, I let them.",,,,
"It's an elective.",,,,
"I think that's kind of the point of all of this, is let the kids be creative, and the ideas that they come up with are going to better than the ones that I was trying to direct them to.",,,,
"So thank you very much for participating with our survey.",,,,
"We, of course, are not going to share any of your information with anyone.",,,,
"We will keep everything confidential.",,,,
"We just want to use this for our internal purposes to make our products better for you.",,,,
"Thank you for your participation at the Veteran Products Educators Conference, and thank you for everything that you are doing.",,,,
"We all right.",,,,
"Thank you.",,,,
"Yeah.",,,,
